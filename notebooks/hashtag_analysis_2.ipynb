My assumption is that even tough there exist categories like is_intolerant that got high disagreement score it's relatively easy to rely on hashtag for this group of categories(is_intolerant, is_political, is_saxony), whereas is_eudaimonic_entertainment and is_hedonic_entertainment are unique and it's difficult to explain these categories solely relying on hashtags, you would need an interplay of all modalities to correctly judge them such as video, audio and text. The model does seem comment more often than human labelers tough and it might indicate that if in case model taking shortcuts it might rather to justify its labels using hashtags, but for now it's just a speculation. \n",

    "This was an older comment -about the first histogram we've seen with naive mean calculation without any normalization steps-, however I still think that it holds true that categories such as is_eudaimonic_entertainment and is_hedonic_entertainment could be used as distinguishing events and we can keep them for the second round as well. However scaling up the categories up until 20 categories, while it might be helpful for sociological analysis, for practical reasons should be avoided, as comments carry more importance for AI analysis and noone would be willing to go through label 20 categories and then comment each of those. 5 categories on the other hand could still be a reasonable limit."
